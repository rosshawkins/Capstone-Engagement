# Capstone-Engagement

This project simulates a Red Team security assessment of a vulnerable system.  Additionally, a Blue Team assessment was conducted following the attack.  

An ELK server was set up with beats in order to log the activity of the attack, to be later analyzed from the Blue Teamâ€™s perspective utilizing Kibana. Proposed alarms and mitigation strategies are also explored in the project.

Details and findings are presented in the slideshow. Enjoy!
